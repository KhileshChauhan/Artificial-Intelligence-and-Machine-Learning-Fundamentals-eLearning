# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Fundamentals
Machine learning and neural networks are fast becoming pillars on which you can build intelligent applications. The course will begin by introducing you to Python and discussing using AI search algorithms. You will learn math-heavy topics, such as regression and classification, illustrated by Python examples.

You will then progress on to advanced AI techniques and concepts, and work on real-life data sets to form decision trees and clusters. You will be introduced to neural networks, which is a powerful tool benefiting from Moore's law applied on 21st-century computing power. By the end of this course, you will feel confident and look forward to building your own AI applications with your newly-acquired skills!



## What you will learn
* Understand the importance, principles, and fields of AI
* Learn to implement basic artificial intelligence concepts with Python
